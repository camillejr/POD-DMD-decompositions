# Short Training Programme at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics

In the summer of 2016 I've spent the two most wonderful months of my life as a stagiaire at the *von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics* in Belgium.

I was working on data decomposition methods: **POD** and **DMD** applied to numerical and experimental data. I developed Matlab GUI for performing data decomposition.

The supervisor of my work was Miguel Alfonso Mendez.

## Repository

This repository is a collection of my work done and is divided into:

`training code`

`GUI development`

`final report`

## Une note pour la Belgique

Apart from developing huge appreciation for linear algebra and Matlab this summer, I also fell in love with Belgium, and in particular with Rhode-Saint-Genèse and Forêt de Soignes.

Here's a picture of Belgium that I carry in my heart, along with many others:
