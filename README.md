# POD and DMD decomposition of numerical and experimental data

## Short Training Programme at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics

In the summer of 2016 I've spent the two most wonderful months of my life as a stagiaire at the *von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics* in Belgium.

I applied two data decomposition methods: **POD** (*Proper Orthogonal Decomposition*) and **DMD** (*Dynamic Mode Decomposition*) to extract temporal and spatial features from numerical or experimental data for fluid flows. I developed a beta-version Matlab GUI for performing data decomposition.

The supervisor of my work was Miguel A. MENDEZ.

## Repository

This repository is a collection of my work done and is divided into:

`training code`

`POD-DMD GUI`

`final report`

## Une note pour la Belgique

Apart from developing huge appreciation for linear algebra and Matlab this summer, I also fell in love with Belgium, and in particular with Rhode-Saint-Genèse and Forêt de Soignes.
