# Short Training Programme at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics

In the summer of 2016 I've spent the two most wonderful months of my life as a stagiaire at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium.

I was working on data decomposition methods: **POD** and **DMD** applied to numerical and experimental data. I developed Matlab GUI for performing data decomposition.

My supervisor was Miguel Alfonso Mendez.

## Repo

This repository is a collection of my work done and is divided into:
