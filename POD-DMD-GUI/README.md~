# POD-DMD GUI

## Code hierarchy

```
Main_MENU
	POD_OR_DMD
```

## `Main_MENU`

Allows to chose type type of dataset from:

```
1D Scalar
2D Scalar
2D Vector
```

### Example:

1D scalar data might be one-dimensional pressure distribution.

2D scalar data might be two-dimensional pressure distribution.

2D vector data might be two-dimensional velocity field.

## `POD_OR_DMD`

Allows to chose decomposition method from:

```
POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition)
DMD (Dynamic Mode Decomposition)
```
