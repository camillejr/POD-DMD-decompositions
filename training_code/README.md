# Training code

This is a collection of Matlab scripts that helped me visualize and understand the mathematics that I was later going to include in the Matlab GUI.

It consists of scripts related to data decomposition, as well as several scripts which were my linear algebra exercises and experiments.

(I believe that with many of the scripts produced, I discovered a new branch of science: `Experimental Mathematics` :) )
